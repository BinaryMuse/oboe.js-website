Streaming JSON loading for Node and browsers
============================================

Oboe.js is an [open source](LICENCE) Javascript library
for loading JSON using streaming, combining the convenience of DOM with
the speed and fluidity of SAX.

It can stream-parse any JSON resource, is small enough to be a [micro-library](http://microjs.com/#),
doesn't have any external dependencies, and doesn't care which other libraries you need it to speak to.

Other tools
-----------

-   For writing JSON streams from a Java server to an Oboe.js front-end try
    [GSON](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/)
-   If you need an even more lightweight JSON stream library and don't
    mind writing [rather more code](parsers#code-comparison-sax), try
    [Clarinet](http://github.com/dscape/clarinet) (In fact, Oboe is
    built on Clarinet)
