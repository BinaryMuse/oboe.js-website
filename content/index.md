Stop waiting for requests to complete by using json content
as soon as it arrives. Select any object, array, or value from
the http response while it is ongoing.

React quickly, even downloading large content on slow networks.

Connect to any standard JSON REST service or streaming REST
service from the same client library.

When a request fails halfway use the part that transferred
without writing special cases.
