Streaming JSON loading for Node and browsers
============================================

Stop waiting for requests to complete by using JSON content as soon as
it arrives. Select any object, array, or value from the http response
while it is ongoing.

-   React quickly, even downloading large content on slow networks.

-   Connect to any standard JSON REST service or streaming REST service
    from the same client library.

-   If a request fails halfway use the part that transferred without
    writing special cases.

Other tools
-----------

-   For writing JSON streams from a Java server try
    [GSON](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/)
-   If you need an even more lightweight JSON stream library and don't
    mind writing more code, try
    [Clarinet](http://github.com/dscape/clarinet) (In fact, Oboe is
    built on Clarinet)
